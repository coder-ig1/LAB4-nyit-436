HW1: KNN & NB
The UC Irvine machine learning data repository hosted a famous dataset (the Pima
HIndians dataset) on whether a patient has diabetes. The dataset is no longer hosted on UCI
ML data repository, but it can still be found here:

Part 1 - Build a KNN classifier to classify the dataset.
● Write standard scaler from scratch - do not scale/z-score features using off-the-shelf
scaler from sklearn
● Scale data using standard scaler
● Split the dataset into training and testing
● Determine the K value, and create a visualization of the accuracy. Report the best K
value
● Run 5 fold cross validations - report mean and standard deviation
● Evaluate using confusion matrix
● Use MARKDOWN cell to explain the accuracy of your model
● retrain using leave-one-out cross validation - report mean and standard deviation
